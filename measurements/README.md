# Benchmark Measurements

This directory contains the recipes and configurations for the performance benchmark campaign.

## Structure

*   **`01_redis_scaling/`**: Recipes for Redis throughput scaling (1 to 256 clients).
*   **`02_ollama_sizing/`**: Recipes for Ollama performance across different model sizes (Small, Medium, Large) and client loads.
*   **`03_vllm_scaling/`**: Recipes for vLLM high-performance inference scaling.
*   **`04_postgres_scaling/`**: Recipes for Postgres transactional scaling using `pgbench`.

## Generation

These recipes are automatically generated by the `scripts/run_campaign.py` script. Do not edit them manually if you intend to regenerate the campaign.

## Execution

To launch the full campaign:
```bash
python3 scripts/run_campaign.py
```
To dry-run (generate recipes only):
```bash
python3 scripts/run_campaign.py --dry-run
```
