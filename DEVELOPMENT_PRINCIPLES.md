# Development Principles - Must Follow

## Ultra User-Friendly First
- **Automatic is better than manual** - The framework should do the right thing automatically
- **One command should do everything** - Users shouldn't need to remember multiple steps
- **Show results immediately** - After running, show exactly where to find outputs
- **Graceful error handling** - Never crash with cryptic errors; provide helpful guidance

## Zero Tech Debt Policy
- **Fix issues immediately** - No "we'll fix it later"
- **Test every feature** - If it doesn't work, fix it before continuing
- **Code must be maintainable** - Clean, documented, modular
- **No shortcuts** - Every line of code should be production-ready

## Implementation Checklist for Every Feature
1. ✅ Design with user experience first
2. ✅ Implement with clean, modular code
3. ✅ Add comprehensive error handling
4. ✅ Test thoroughly (unit and integration)
5. ✅ Document clearly
6. ✅ Verify no technical debt remains

## Current Status
- ✅ Artifact pipeline implemented and tested
- ✅ Automatic collection/reporting working
- ✅ All critical bugs fixed
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Next Steps (Following These Principles)
- Week 3: GUI integration with automatic artifact display
- Week 4: KF1 Saturation Finder (automatic detection)
- Week 4: KF5 One Page Summary (automatic generation)
- Optional: Monitoring prep (disabled by default)

Remember: Every implementation must be tested and working before moving to the next feature.
